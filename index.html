<!-- ---- PSEUDOCODE ----

1. Welcome message welcoming the user to the RPS game
2. Tell the user the rules.
3. Prompt the user for a selection of r, p, or s.
  a. This should be case insensitive
4. The program then randomly makes a selection for the computer.
5. Compare the user's selection with the computer's selection.
6. If the player's selection is greater than computer's selection, alert the player that they've won
7. Else alert the player that the computer has won.
8. Increase the count (i.e. game count) by 1 from 0.
9. If count < 5, loop through the code again.. including the user selection prompt.
10. If count == 5, alert the user that the game is over.

-->

<!-- ---- PROJECT PARAMETERS ----

1. Begin with a function called 'computerPlay' that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.
We'll use this function in the game to make the computer's play.

2. Write a function that plays a single round of RPS.
The function should take two parameters: playerSelection and computerSelection,
and return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock!"

a. Make your function case insensitive so users can enter 'rock','ROCK', 'RocK', etc.

b. Important Note: You want to return the results of this function call, not console.log them.
To test this function console.log the results.

3. Write a new function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game
that keeps score and reports a winner or lose at the end.

a. You have not offically learned how to "loop" over code to repeat function calls.
If you already know about loops from somewhere else feel free to use them.
If not, don't worry! Just call your playRound function 5 times in a row.

b. At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.

c. Use prompt() to get input from the user.

d. Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to.
Specifically you might want to change the return value to something more useful.

e. Feel free to create more 'helper' functions if you think it would be useful.
